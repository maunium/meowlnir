# Meowlnir
An opinionated Matrix moderation bot. Optimized for Synapse, but works with
other server implementations to some extent.

## Discussion
Matrix room: [#meowlnir:maunium.net](https://matrix.to/#/#meowlnir:maunium.net)

## Setup
Docker images can be found at [`dock.mau.dev/maunium/meowlnir`] and binaries
are built in [mau.dev CI] the same way as all mautrix bridges. `build.sh` also
works the same way as in bridges.

[`dock.mau.dev/maunium/meowlnir`]: https://mau.dev/maunium/meowlnir/container_registry
[mau.dev CI]: https://mau.dev/maunium/meowlnir/-/pipelines?ref=main

### Configuration
The example config can be found in [./config/example-config.yaml]. Meowlnir
requires its own database (both SQLite and Postgres are supported), and can use
read-only access to the Synapse database for optional features and performance
improvements.

[./config/example-config.yaml]: (https://github.com/maunium/meowlnir/blob/main/config/example-config.yaml).

#### Notes on Synapse database access
A read-only user can be created with something like this:

```sql
CREATE USER meowlnir WITH PASSWORD '...';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE synapse TO meowlnir;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO meowlnir;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO meowlnir;
```

The current primary reason Meowlnir reads the database directly is to get
events to redact more efficiently, and to find soft-failed events (which
may not have soft-failed on other servers).

To make finding events more efficient, you may want to add an index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX meowlnir_event_sender_idx ON events (room_id, sender);
```

### Appservice registration
After configuring Meowlnir itself, make a registration file, such as this:

```yaml
# ID and tokens must be exactly the same as in the Meowlnir config.
id: ...
as_token: ...
hs_token: ...
# The URL where the homeserver can reach Meowlnir.
url: http://localhost:29339
# This doesn't matter, just needs to be unique.
sender_localpart: any random string here
# Meowlnir will not handle ratelimits, so this must be false.
rate_limited: false
# Meowlnir uses MSC3202, MSC4190 and MSC4203 for encryption, so they must be enabled.
org.matrix.msc3202: true
io.element.msc4190: true
# push_ephemeral is the old name of receive_ephemeral, as Synapse hasn't stabilized MSC2409 support yet.
# Enabling 2409/receive_ephemeral is required for MSC4203.
de.sorunome.msc2409.push_ephemeral: true
receive_ephemeral: true
# Add the bots you want here. If you only want one bot, a static regex is enough.
# Multiple bots are supported too and can be dynamically added if you set a non-static regex (e.g. `@moderation_.+:example\.com`)
namespaces:
  users:
  - regex: '@abuse:example\.com'
    exclusive: true
```

Additionally, you'll need to enable some experimental features in the Synapse config:

```yaml
experimental_features:
  # Actually MSC4203, but it was previously a part of MSC2409
  msc2409_to_device_messages_enabled: true
  # MSC3202 has two parts, both need to be enabled
  msc3202_device_masquerading: true
  msc3202_transaction_extensions: true
```

If you use a homeserver without MSC4203/MSC3202 support, or don't want to enable
them in Synapse, you can use Meowlnir without them by disabling encryption
support entirely in the Meowlnir config.

### Creating bots
You may have noticed that the config file doesn't have anything about the bot
username or management rooms. This is because the bots and management rooms can
be created dynamically at runtime and are saved in the database. The management
secret specified in the config is used to authenticate with the API that can
create bots.

Currently existing endpoints:

* `GET /_meowlnir/v1/bots` - List all bots
* `PUT /_meowlnir/v1/bot/{localpart}` - Create a bot
* `POST /_meowlnir/v1/bot/{localpart}/verify` - Cross-sign a bot's device
* `PUT /_meowlnir/v1/management_room/{roomID}` - Define a room as a management room

There will be a CLI and/or web UI later, but for now, you can use curl:

```shell
export AUTH="Authorization: Bearer $MANAGEMENT_SECRET"
```

First, create a bot. This example copies matrix.org's admin bot (`abuse` as the
username, `Administrator` as the displayname, and the same avatar):

```shell
curl -H "$AUTH" https://meowlnir.example.com/_meowlnir/v1/bot/abuse -XPUT -d '{"displayname": "Administrator", "avatar_url": "mxc://matrix.org/NZGChxcCXbBvgkCNZTLXlpux"}'
```

Assuming you didn't have an @abuse user before or if it didn't have encryption,
you can have Meowlnir generate cross-signing keys to verify itself. This
command will return the recovery key. Make sure to save it!

```shell
curl -H "$AUTH" https://meowlnir.example.com/_meowlnir/v1/bot/abuse/verify -d '{"generate": true}'
```

Alternatively, if the user already has cross-signing set up, you can provide
the recovery key for verification:

```shell
curl -H "$AUTH" https://meowlnir.example.com/_meowlnir/v1/bot/abuse/verify -d '{"recovery_key": "EsT* ****..."}'
```

Finally, you need to define a management room. Create the room normally, get
the room ID and run:

```shell
curl -H "$AUTH" -X PUT 'https://meowlnir.example.com/_meowlnir/v1/management_room/!randomroomid:example.com' -d '{"bot_username": "abuse"}'
```

After defining the room, you can invite the bot, and it should accept the invite
(you can also invite the bot beforehand if you prefer).

### Configuring the bot
The bot will read state events in the management room to determine which policy
lists to subscribe to and which rooms to protect. Adding these will happen with
commands in the future, but for now, you can send state events manually.

#### Subscribing to policy lists
The `fi.mau.meowlnir.watched_lists` state event is used to subscribe to policy
lists. The state key must be empty and the content must have a `lists` key,
which is a list of objects. Each object must contain `room_id`, `shortcode` and
`name`, and may specify certain extra flags (documented below).

For example, the event below will apply CME bans to protected rooms, as well as
watch matrix.org's lists without applying them to rooms (i.e. the bot will send
messages when the list adds policies, but won't take action based on those).

```json
{
	"lists": [
		{
			"auto_unban": true,
			"name": "CME bans",
			"room_id": "!fTjMjIzNKEsFlUIiru:neko.dev",
			"shortcode": "cme"
		},
		{
			"auto_unban": true,
			"dont_apply": true,
			"name": "matrix.org coc",
			"room_id": "!WuBtumawCeOGEieRrp:matrix.org",
			"shortcode": "morg-coc"
		},
		{
			"auto_unban": true,
			"dont_apply": true,
			"name": "matrix.org tos",
			"room_id": "!tUPwPPmVTaiKXMiijj:matrix.org",
			"shortcode": "morg-tos"
		}
	]
}
```

When you send the event adding a new watched list, Meowlnir will confirm it was
successful by sending a message. If you added a list and no message was sent,
you probably did something wrong.

To make the bot join a policy list, use the `!join <room ID or alias>` command.

Available extra flags:

* `dont_apply` - Watch the list (send notifications) without taking action based
  on the policies.
* `dont_apply_acl` - Watch the list and apply all other actions, except for
  updating `m.room.server_acl` events in protected rooms.
* `auto_unban` - Automatically unban users if the policy that triggered the ban
  is removed.
* `auto_suspend` - If a policy bans a local user, suspend them using the Synapse
  admin API automatically. The bot user must be marked as a server admin.
* `dont_notify_on_change` - Don't send management room notifications when
  policies are added, removed or modified. Useful if you have multiple
  management rooms and don't want to be spammed in all of them.

#### Protecting rooms
Protected rooms are listed in the `fi.mau.meowlnir.protected_rooms` state event.
The state key must be empty and the event content is simply a `rooms` key which
is a list of room IDs.

You can also use the `!rooms protect <id or alias>` command instead of sending
the state event manually.

```json
{
	"rooms": [
		"!randomid:example.com",
		"!anotherrandomid:example.com"
	]
}
```

After adding rooms to this list, you can invite the bot to the room, or use the
`!join` command.

#### Blocking invites
To use policy lists for blocking incoming invites, install the
[synapse-http-antispam] module, then configure it with the ID of the management
room you want to use plus the antispam API token from the Meowlnir config file:

[synapse-http-antispam]: https://github.com/maunium/synapse-http-antispam

```yaml
modules:
  - module: synapse_http_antispam.HTTPAntispam
    config:
      base_url: http://localhost:29339/_meowlnir/antispam/<management room ID>
      authorization: <value of antispam.secret>
      enabled_callbacks:
      - user_may_invite
      - user_may_join_room
      async:
        user_may_join_room: true
```

The `user_may_invite` callback is used to block invites from users who are
banned on any of the policy lists that the management room is subscribed to.

The `user_may_join_room` callback is used to track whether non-blocked invites
have been accepted. If `auto_reject_invites_token` is set in the config,
Meowlnir will automatically reject pending invites to rooms from banned users.
Even if this callback is not enabled, Meowlnir will still check whether the
invites are pending to avoid rejecting already-accepted invites.

### Configuring your reverse proxy to interact with Meowlnir
To have Meowlnir interact with your server (e.g. receiving reports) it is necessary that your reverse proxy forwards traffic to Meowlnir.
Add those lines to your proxy:
```
^/_matrix/client/v3/rooms/.*/report
^/_matrix/client/v3/rooms/.*/report/.*
^/_matrix/client/v3/users/.*/report
^/_matrix/policy/*
^/_meowlnir //currently not used but for future proof
```

### Running on a non-Synapse server
While Meowlnir is designed to be used with Synapse, it can be used with other
server implementations as well.

If your server doesn't support all the MSCs mentioned in the appservice
registration section, set `encryption` -> `enable` to `false` to disable
encryption entirely.

The Synapse database connection can be skipped by leaving `type` and `uri`
blank in the config. However, redacting messages from banned users will only
work if you either provide a Synapse database or implement [MSC4194] on the
server.

You can technically point it at another server's database too; it doesn't have
to be the database of the server the bot is connected to. If doing that, ensure
that the Synapse is in all the protected rooms so that it receives all events
that may need to be redacted in the future.
