  non-Synapse homeservers.
* Added `!kick` command to kick users from all protected rooms.
* Added support for blocking incoming invites on Synapse.
  * Requires installing the [synapse-http-antispam] module to forward callbacks
    to Meowlnir.
  * Pending invites can also be automatically rejected using a double puppeting
    appservice if the ban comes in after the invite.
* Added support for [MSC4204]: `m.takedown` moderation policy recommendation.
* Added support for [MSC4205]: Hashed moderation policy entities.
* Fixed events not being redacted if the user left before being banned.
* Updated `!match` command to list protected rooms where the user is joined.

  `<no reason supplied>`. The ban will be sent without a reason instead.
* Changed management room to ignore unverified devices to implement [MSC4153].
